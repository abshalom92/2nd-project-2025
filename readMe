In this project, I seek to create the foundation of boardgames, such as chess, checkers, and even building out mazes. 
The first phase of the project will result in an interactive gameboard on a webpage that shows interactivity when I click on the board. 
in the second phase of the project, I want to build out a checkers game starting from the gameboard webpage.
In the third phase, I want to build out a chess game. 
In the fourth phase, I would like to build out a maze generator. 
Finally, I want to create the web home page that has a navbar to the different games along with some sort of clickable element on the center of the page that lets me nav to the respective game. 

for 8/27/25 and beyond will need to:
 fix the back buttons
 add the rps logic
 link rps radio buttons to render their respective images in the battleground div.
 beautify radio buttons.... i.e, border radius, change shape, text bkg, etc. 
 set up game stats hover logic/counter

completed on 8/27
- was able to get the battleground to show my play and opponent play. 

for 8/28 and beyond, will need to:
 add the rps logic
 fix the back buttons
 beautify radio buttons.... i.e, border radius, change shape, text bkg, etc. 
 set up game stats hover logic/counter

 8/28 - worked on manually figuring out win logic, but I can't wrap my head around it. ChatGPT gave me a few answers that made sense, but I need to redo some of the code tomorrow now that I know the answer. gotta sleep on it to bake in the knowledge.
